# Whether or not failover will happen automatically when the master
# fails. Set to false if you want to receive the failover notifications
# but not have EFM actually perform the failover steps.
# The value of this property must be the same across all agents.
auto.failover=true

# After a standby is promoted, failover manager will attempt to
# update the remaining standbys to use the new master. Failover
# manager will back up recovery.conf, change the host parameter
# of the primary_conninfo entry, and restart the database. The
# restart command is contained in the efm_functions file; default
# is: "pg_ctl restart -m fast -w -t <timeout> -D <directory>"
# where the timeout is the local.timeout property value and the
# directory is specified by db.recovery.conf.dir. To turn off
# automatic reconfiguration, set this property to false.
auto.reconfigure=true

# The value for the password property should be the output from
# 'efm encrypt' -- do not include clear text password here. To
# prevent accidental sharing of passwords among clusters, the cluster
# name is incorporated into the encrypted password. If you change
# the cluster name (the name of this file), you must encrypt the
# password again with the new name.
# The db.port property must be the same for all nodes.

# This property controls how many times a database connection is reused
# before creating a new one. If set to zero, a new connection will be
# created every time an agent pings its local database.

# Use this property to enable ssl for EFM connections. Setting this property
# to true will force the agents to use 'ssl=true' for all JDBC database
# connections, both to local and remote databases.

# This property controls the port binding of the administration server
# which is used for some commands (ie cluster-status).

# These properties apply to the connection(s) EFM uses to monitor
# the local database. Every 'local.period' seconds, a database check
# is made in a background thread. If the main monitoring thread does
# not see that any checks were successful in 'local.timeout' seconds,
# then the main thread makes a final check with a timeout value
# specified by the 'local.timeout.final' value. All values are in seconds.
# Whether EFM uses single or multiple connections for database checks
# is controlled by the 'db.reuse.connection.count' property.

# nodes. Description copied from jgroups:
#
# Max tries: Number of times to send an are-you-alive message.
# Timeout (in ms): Timeout to suspect a node P if neither a heartbeat
# nor data were received from P.

# This property specifies the ip address and port that jgroups
# will bind to on this node. The value is of the form <ip>:<port>.

# other nodes, and is not the same as the admin.port above, used
# only to communicate with the local agent to send control signals.

# This property tells EFM which OS user owns the $PGDATA dir for the
# 'db.database'.  By default, the owner is either 'postgres' for PostgreSQL
# or 'enterprisedb' for Postgres Plus Advanced Server.  However, if you
# have configured your db to run as a different user, you will need to
# copy the /etc/sudoers.d/efm-XX conf file to grant the
# necessary permissions to your db owner.
#
# This username must have write permission to the 'db.recovery.conf.dir'
# specified below.
db.service.owner=enterprisedb

# Specify the location of the db recovery.conf file on the node. On
# a standby node, the trigger file location is read from the file in
# this directory. After a failover, the recovery.conf files on
# remaining standbys are changed to point to the new master db (a copy
# of the original is made first). On a master node, a recovery.conf file will
# be written during failover and promotion to ensure that the master node can
# not be restarted as the master database.
db.recovery.conf.dir=/opt/PostgresPlus/9.5AS/data

# This is the IP and netmask that will be remapped during fail over.  If you do
# not use VIPs as part of your failover solution, then leave these properties
# blank to disable EFM's support for VIP processing (assigning, releasing,
# testing reachability, etc).
#
# If you enable VIP, then all three properties are required.

# The address and netmask must be the same across all agents.

# EFM nodes.
#
# There are many reasons why this node might not be considered reachable:
